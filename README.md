What is Atomia DNS?
-------------------

Atomia DNS is a multi tenant system for handling large amounts of DNS 
data through programmatic interfaces.

Atomia DNS also contains synchronization agents for making sure that this
data hits all of your nameservers. Agents for PowerDNS and Bind-DLZ are
included.

In addition Atomia DNS includes a number of clients for making management
simple, in no particular order:
* Command line management through atomiadnsclient (atomiadns-client)
* Web-management through atomiadns-webapp
* Zone-file import through atomiadns-zoneimport
* Helpers included in the sync agents
